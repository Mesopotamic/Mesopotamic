# Mesopotamic

Welcome to my very own ancient Mesopotamian themed cross platform Vulkan framework. Not quite a game engine for those who don't want all the work done for them, but also find Vulkan boilerplate code annoying.

The project is split into three different subprojects:

- VkClay
- VkTablet
- Zigurat 

All of these subprojects come together in order to produce the overall mesopotamic framework. This repo is the combination of those submodules, along with some CMake helpers, and some examples!

## Legal Summary

As of time of writing this *(December 2021)* The Log4J vulnerabilities have made big tech's abuse of open source projects abundantly clear. Therefore this project and all subprojects come with a custom license. which can be summarised as such :

> *If you are using Mesopatmic or any of it's submodules for private or educational use, then you are absolutely free to go ahead and use this project in any way you want without credit or license. All over use cases must either be totally open source, or you can pay towards the maintenance of the project.*

(Also can we all appreciate that I didn't use the pun "legal *Sumer*-ry")

## Build 

All Mesopatamic projects use CMake, I think this makes it easiest to build projects, essentially allowing users to just drop it into their preexisting cmake projects.
