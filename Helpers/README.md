# Helpers

These are little tiny helper libraries that I think can come in handy. Basically as I've been writing mesopotamic, I've come across a feature I would like implemented and I've put it here. It's kind of like my own version of boost. 

All subprojects here will have an MIT licence, so feel free to drop these into your own projects!

They all have a MESO_BUILD_STATIC, which builds the library as a static component. This makes life 100 times easier when you are working on the library itself, because you don't have to copy the library across every time you make a change.

There is also a CMake Helper project to help make cmake bearable
